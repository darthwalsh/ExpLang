# Performance


Rules + Training Date + Compute Code

Don't version-control the intermediate database state
structured data format? YAML?

## Fast Addition

123+254

         #10  #1
123 $"a"(/(\d+)(\d))
254 $"b"   => concat

$a#10+$b#10+$c
$a#1+$b#2


LET $x=$a#1+$b#2
IF PARSE $x || \d / then carry 1 else carry 0
```

- [ ] Algorithm might want LEFT IF

## Multiplication

- [ ] Hardcode all facts??? (for single digit)

```
3*4=>
  3+3+3+3
```

- [ ] Algorithm might want tree construction??

## Contest


* Could this be a contest to program algorithm quickly?
    * minimal code
    * minimal storage

Need to find balance between costs:

- Human brain: each eval takes 1 tick
- Indexed lookup: 1
- Scan : 1 / row
